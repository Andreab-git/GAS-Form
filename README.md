# GAS-Form

Are you looking for a way to create a form that allows you to upload files to your drive? <br>
Would you like your files to be organised to your liking? <br>
Would you like anyone, even anonymous people, to be able to fill in your form? <br>

If that's what you're looking for then this project is for you!

## What do you need?

You need to have a <i>**Google account**</i> and _**create a new Google App Script**_ project in your drive. 

## How it works?

After deploying the project you can access the form using the url.<br>
In the form you can fill in some fields such as first name, last name, email and upload a file. <br> 
After filling in all the fields you can submit the form which, after obtaining confirmation from the Google server that the form has been successfully uploaded, will redirect you to the Greetings page. <br>
Behind the scenes the results of the form will be saved in a SpreadSheet while the uploaded file will be saved in a folder within the drive.<br>
The files will be organised within it according to year and email address. <br>
Once the data has been saved, an email will be sent to confirm receipt of the form.
